# Dye_et_al_2023_rockling
RStudio project to statistically analyze (i.e. reproduce results from Dye et al. 2023) the compartmental usage of the five bearded rockling within an experimental water temperature preference chamber.
- rockling_temperature_preference.R - Statistically analyze the data for non random use of the preference chamber, conduct MANOVA to test for differences in compartment usage during the different observational phases, rank the temperature compartments (i.e. most preferred to least preferred), and statistically test the preference rankings.
- rockling_shelter_preference.R - Statistically analyze the data for differences in compartment usage (i.e. temperature preference) during physical structure removals (Please see publication sections for further information: 2.3. Experimental protocol and 3.3 Trade-off between temperature and structure).

Abstract

`
Changes in the environment can alter the suitability of habitats for organisms. In marine systems, fish species
have their own specific requirements in terms of temperature and other habitat features. Behavioral responses
such as thermoregulatory behavior in ectothermic species allow mobile organisms to respond to detrimental
changes and search for more suitable habitats. However, for many species, limited information exists on the ecological
requirements to help explain species abundance in a changing habitat. An example of a quickly changing
habitat is the Wadden Sea, where five bearded rockling (Ciliata mustela) abundance has increased, unlike other
Wadden Sea species. The increasing abundance of rockling has coincided with increasing average sea water temperatures
and the recovery of mussel and Pacific oyster beds. Warming waters and increased structural habitat
may have provided rockling with a more desirable habitat. Therefore, to better understand why rockling abundance
is increasing within a changing Wadden Sea, a water temperature preference chamber was used to determine
rockling's preferred temperature range. In addition, rockling's affinity for structural habitat and the tradeoff
between preferred temperature was examined by following their response to the systematic removal of artificial
physical structures within the preferred temperature conditions. The preferred temperature range of rockling
was found to be 10.4–15.7 °C. Following structure removals, rockling repeatedly moved away from their chosen
temperatures to adjacent compartments with different temperatures but containing physical structure, indicating
that the presence of physical structure was more important than preferred temperature until 18.6 °C. These novel
findings provide insight and experimental support for the hypothesis explaining rockling's increase in the Wadden
Sea: 1) mean annual temperatures have been steadily increasing towards rockling's preferred thermal range
and 2) increasing mussel and Pacific oyster beds are plausibly providing structural habitat, an important habitat
requirement for rockling. When fish display a strong association with physical structure it is necessary to link
physiological and habitat preferences to better understand climate change related responses.
